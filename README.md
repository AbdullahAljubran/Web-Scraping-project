# Web Scraping with Python

This project demonstrates how to perform web scraping using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The notebook (`web_scraping.ipynb`) contains code that retrieves information from web pages, parses the HTML content, and extracts useful data for further analysis or storage.

## Features

- Send HTTP requests to websites
- Parse HTML content using BeautifulSoup
- Extract specific data (e.g., titles, links, text content)
- Basic data cleaning and formatting
- Output the scraped data in a readable format

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
